# Creating images for Twitter, the blog, etc. 

For all our graphic needs we use Canva. 

## Blog post headers

There is a file called "blog post header" that has all the blog posts we've been creating images for. Blog headers all have right-aligned boxes and titles. 

* The title of the blog should be the main text
* Pick one of their images that has some connection to the content, even if it's very abstract
* The color of the box for the text should match a color used in the image
  * Pick a dark color so that it's high-contrast
  * The typeface should always be white
* Rename the individual image to match whatever the topic is
* Before uploading to Wordpress, make sure to rename it something useful and descriptive

## Webinar images

These are also in the "blog post header", though hopefully we'll pull them out into a separate template before long. Webinar images take up most of the image space and are centered. 

* Use the right side of the image to provide information about the speaker(s) and their roles/organization.
* Use the left side for the title of the event and date/time info 

## Youtube covers

These are in their own file. The LFPH icon in the lower right corner should always be on an on-brand navy background and never get covered up. The image should wrap and go behind the full title box and the icon. The image does not have to be full size, but it shouldn't be obvious where the image starts/ends. In other words, make sure that if the image is not full size behind the title, the background color is matched so it looks seamless. See "Introduction to Overlays Capture" as an example of this. 

If the videos are all part of a series, use the same background image but then rotate screenshots to "float" over each graphic. See the Travel Credentials Series for an example of this. 

## Twitter images

These are also in their own file. Feel free to get creative with these, so long as the image stays "on brand".
