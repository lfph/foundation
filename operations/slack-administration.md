# Slack Administration

## Slackbot

* As a Slack administrator, you can see the automatic replies and messages we send everyone based on certain triggers. We could make more use of these. 

## Greetbot

* One of the main tools we have to onboard people to Slack that is very easy to forget about is [Greetbot](https://greet.bot/account). This sends a welcome series to anyone who signs up for our Slack instance, and especially since we don't have Slack hooked up to HubSpot it allows what's effectively a drip campaign. 
* You can view all the messages we're currently sending [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ksVvWIVfJ88z7v-ytCJusc5nctAtQMk3B3bgv85z0QU/edit). This can always use updating.
* This is also the tool that we use to try and prompt people to add something to #introductions, so we know who joins when. It's worked okay. 

## Introductions

* Support our newcomers by trying to message people when they post to #introductions
* Keep an eye on this channel to try and help them get to the right place

## Archive

* Every 2-3 weeks we archive all public messages on the Slack since the message retention is so short. 
* These archives get uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w6tSKskP8CmWAFNBsLejQ8aANHq4IUJ3).
