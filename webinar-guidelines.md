# LFPH Webinar Guidelines

## Overview
LFPH webinars are hosted by maintainers, members, and staff and provide an opportunity to share their progress with the LFPH community. Webinars are hosted on Zoom and the recordings are posted to the LFPH YouTube channel. You can view past webinars at https://www.lfph.io/webinars. 

English language webinars are scheduled approximately once a month on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday in the morning. 
  
We have outlined content guidelines and timelines below. Webinars that do not meet the requirements may be cancelled. If the webinar is cancelled due to not meeting these guidelines, the member will not be allowed to schedule a webinar in the subsequent webinar period. That is, premier and general members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming quarter and silver members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming 6 months.

## Who can host a webinar
* Premier members can host 1 webinar a quarter
* General members can host 2 webinars a year.
* Public health authority associate members and Academic or nonprofit associate members can host 1 webinar a year.
* LFPH maintainers can host 2 webinars a year.
* LFPH staff will host webinars on an as-needed basis.
  
## Webinar content guidelines
* These should be educational webinars, whether by presenting information about a general topic to our audience, hosting a debate, or having a discussion about an area of focus related to the work of LFPH. Potential areas of inspiration:
  * Why you decided to go with open source and what advantages you've seen from it
  * Lessons learned from collaborative development
  * Partnering with public health authorities
  * Different use cases based on the jurisdictions using your tool
  * Evaluation of the public health impact of a given intervention
* **No product pitches.** It is okay to do a comparison of part of the landscape, but webinars should not be promotional.
* Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source and work with LFPH. 
* Slides should be professional and follow presentation best practices. Feel free to reach out to LFPH staff if you have any questions about this.
* Please do not read your slides.
  
### Members can add a slide at the end of their webinar on where to get more information. Examples:
* Share contact info of speaker - Twitter, Slack, email
* Links to company websites (not the LFPH website)
* Links to projects websites or Github
* Can advertise if they are hiring and who to contact if interested

LFPH will review the slide, as we do for the content for the webinar, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes.

## Topic suggestions
* Anyone is welcome to submit their webinar ideas or speaker suggestions by emailing webinars@lfph.io.
