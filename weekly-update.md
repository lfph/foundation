 :cherries: For #herald-general:
- Herald news - we’re testing a v2.10-beta4 release for Android and iOS. This includes new callbacks for convenience for app developers that will show when a detected device is confirmed as a herald device, and when a previously detected device has been out of range/detection for some time, and is deleted. It’ll also include a full working preview of the GPDMP (General Purpose Distributed Messaging Protocol) which is to be used for emergency/disaster communication, and in future perhaps for a fully decentralised digital contact tracing system under the OpenTrace v2.0 umbrella. Initial test results for v2.1.0-beta4 show more stability on iOS, better error handling, and improved contact logging in the demo app which we use for calculating efficacy and reliability statistics.

 :helicopter: From #cardea:
- Cardea spent time reviewing and renaming project agents and the associated repos to reflect the broader use cases (drug testing, employee health requirements and school health requirements). We are off next week and will reconvene on October 27 for a discussion on outreach and APIs.

 :sunny: For #tac :
- If anyone has old iPhones or Android phones dating back from present day to 2011 (i.e. the first Bluetooth Low Energy phones) and want to donate to a good cause, I’d like to collect a much wider range of models for Herald testing. UK/EU ones can be sent to me (DM for address details), Americas and Asia addresses TBD. We want to run a range of new calibration tests for Herald both for digital contact tracing reliability, but also for a new ‘emergency communications system’ for when disasters occur and broadband goes down but people are still travelling around with phones in their pockets. This necessitates a lot more phones than prior. We have about 20 test phones - we need 100+ ideally. So if anyone wants to donate a current or older phones to a good cause that’d be great! A variety of makes and models and OS versions - so please don’t update to the latest before sending! (Please do factory reset them though and remove personal data, and de-register on Android!!!). Thanks!
- Have a public health technology idea that you're interested in refining or developing? Reach out to #tac and @Adam! Either 15 or 30 minutes presentations are accepted (including Q&A) - can be to introduce or update on an existing project, or another cool project that might be useful to other LFPH projects, or a topic for discussion. E.g. Consent or Privacy. Totally fine if its a first presentation - we’re happy to work with people to prep a presentation!

 :mega: From LFPH members:
- Hello! One Fact Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with a mission to change global health care using open source principles. To accomplish this, we are releasing [ClinicalBERT](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/clinicalBERT), an algorithm for clinicians that has 300+ citations and is used to predict clinical outcomes.
- The algorithm uses information from structured and unstructured information in electronic health records.
- We work with several academic medical centers across the world to continue developing our user experience research approach. The goal is to display predictions from the model about a patient's risk to clinicians, to best help them make decisions that improve health. Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05342](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05342)
- We also work across languages and cultures: I was in Estonia this summer to work with the former CIO (who is on our board) and a team at Tartu University who re-trained this model in Estonian to show it can work for a country with nowhere near the amount of data available in the United States, and still make accurate predictions.
- Please reach out to me: [jaan@onefact.org](jaan@onefact.org) as we are a new member of Linux Foundation for Public Health and excited to collaborate with you all!! (More on our mission is in the talk I gave at the NIH's [aim-ahead.net](http://aim-ahead.net/) conference recently: [bit.ly/onefact-keynote](http://bit.ly/onefact-keynote))

 :herald: For the Herald Project #herald-general
- The Herald Project are looking for feedback on a potential eHealth Maker’s Kit. The idea is to garner some of the community device hacking spirit from Arduino and Raspberry Pi and focus that on a low-cost and flexible eHealth platform based on the wearable designs in The Herald Project. Any funds raised through selling the kit could be pushed back into Herald and LFPH to pay for things (E.g. Bluetooth registrations etc.). Can I please ask that this community if you have any Maker’s or STEM teachers/students you know, please forward this link and ask them to leave feedback. Thanks![https://github.com/theheraldproject/herald-hardware/issues/15](https://github.com/theheraldproject/herald-hardware/issues/15)

:crown: For #herald-general:
- The Herald Team :herald: has recently released v2.1.0-beta2 of the Herald for iOS API! This includes Analysis API improvements to allow a team from [Operation Outbreak](https://operationoutbreak.org/), a Herald powered application since last year, to develop and test new risk scoring and distance conversion algorithms.
- The full v2.1.0 final release will include the whole Data Analysis API, a memory, compute and battery efficient live data analysis and aggregation mechanism (as in mathematical - i.e. statistical summaries over time periods) of proximity and other sensor data capture my mobile phones or wearables. Particularly useful for long term monitoring of a patient's condition with a wearable or mobile device connected to Bluetooth devices.
- The full v2.1.0 release will also include the first implementation of Bluetooth MESH in Herald for Smart Hospitals (C++ repository only) with demonstration beacon apps and a link to RabbitMQ for command and control and data publishing (I.e. to power a "Where's my syringe pusher?" app for hospitals!). The v2.1.0 full release will include a preview of the General Purpose Distributed Messaging Protocol (GPDMP - I'm still bad at naming things) across all of embedded (C++), iOS and Android Herald API, which can be used as a Bluetooth low-energy only distributed secure message passing mechanism for civil emergencies. This is important as it means low cost and older devices from 2011 until now can participate in civil emergency message receipt and passing.
- You can read the iOS v2.1.0-beta2 release notes here: https://github.com/theheraldproject/herald-for-ios/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta2 or from our CocoaPod here: https://cocoapods.org/pods/Herald

:herald: For #herald-general:
- A new version of herald-analysis (an R library script with examples) will be released that includes a working approach to phone Bluetooth signal strength self-calibration based on data collected from the Herald demo app.
- This uses ideas from Proxemics to self-calibrate a phone based on a persons interactions with other humans - close contacts, acquaintances, and people passing nearby. Calibrating these common contact proximities on a person’s phone makes risk scoring more accurate, and also calibrates to things due to their behavior, such as always placing their phone the same way in their pocket or bag.
- Initial testing shows after calibration, the two mutual contacts’ risk scores were within 7.5% of each other!
- These calibrations can be further tuned from ‘norms’ in particular societies, if required. We’re going to trial it further before creating a Social Mixing Score UI component in Herald for other app developers to use. The mechanism itself and an example will be in the next version of the Herald API, as part of the Risk and Exposure API examples.

:hot_pepper: For #cardea:
* The date for our next Interop-athon is Thursday, March 17, 2022.
* We’ll be testing Out-of-Band (OOB) invitations with those whose agents who are able to receive them (we will be able to accommodate old-style invitations too). This will be a valuable opportunity to test and tune agents ahead of Aries Community adoption of OOB on March 31 — and we encourage any company who wants to test their agents to join us— regardless of their interest in Cardea or health credentials.
* We will also be testing basic machine readable governance (MRG).
*A reference implementation for both OOB and MRG will be made available shortly—and we’ll have office hours to help people with installation well ahead of the event. Timings, sign up sheets to come!

:mango: For #cci:
* After a few months of work at the Practical Governance Task Force led by @errancarmel and @sankarshan, the [Digital Health Credential System Implementation Guide V1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Zr_apBF8f9sMNaTWf8mN8DfHMnEQRVWFZmOvsI3E_c/edit?usp=sharing) was moved from Pre-Draft to Draft stage at the Global Implementation Forum (recording of the discussion [here](https://zoom.us/rec/play/-DiDXIhQNVrHsTZ66fSlfe0f5BRmxj-japFO6DCbll8fDK6K3NUqLwF7XXcrq9bfZoq4XmIHlJo0WcVF.3QJOGIvIf4g0VM2c?startTime=1644332421000&_x_zm_rtaid=cMDhAUa_SDeTC_YE5X5reg.1644525958376.dff6c60ba2cd30dff44ec4e833de841b&_x_zm_rhtaid=350)).
* Inspired by the Good Health Pass work, the #cci-practical-governance-tf (formerly the Rules and Governance Workstream) created this simple guide to help implementers understand what requirements a digital health credential system needs to meet to be called “Good”. This can be used by implementers before starting their product development as a guide for their design considerations and a benchmark while developing and iterating on their products. 
* As the next step, until Feb 18, we are inviting the community to comment on this Draft deliverable, particularly on the following:
   * If the overall structure of the guide is easy to understand by implementers and the general public
   * If the guide covers the most important requirements 
   * If the requirements are reasonable and actionable
   * If the requirements are communicated clearly 
* We look forward to receiving your comments!

:thread: The #cardea Interop-athon was a big success—not only in proving interoperability but in discovering glitches that prevented it. Keep an eye on the LFPH blog next week for more on the event—we’ll be discussing some of the technical aspects in detail in future Cardea meetings, but first—DemoDay on the 23rd will showcase Interop-athon participants interoperating!

:sewing_needle: For CCI,
* Application for our 2021 Steering Committee Members Election is open until 11:59 pm PT on September 15. We made it open this week the candidate marking sheet for applicants to refer to when preparing their CVs and Written/Video Pitches.

* The US Vaccine Credential Subgroup #cci-vaccinecredentialsfg-us met (recording here) to discuss what should the group focus on moving forward and how we can keep providing value. We had consensus from the group that we were going to expand the conversation to beyond vaccine credential and rename the group to become the North American Group. Similar to the APAC group, we will keep working with the community members to identify topics and have presentations and conversations relevant to the region.
* The Use Case Implementation Workstream’s next call on September 14 at 7 am PT / 2 pm UTC will have two professors from American University and University of Arkansas to share a “strawperson” (draft) list of 22 foundational requirements for Digital Health Passes, derived largely from the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.

We have also established the first running instance of “MedCreds inside” utilizing the open source code, a brand new instance from scratch at app.proofengage.io.  We’re still running it through testing and plan to open it up for anyone to establish their own “Engage, with MedCreds inside” wallet soon!

:herald: The third update is from Herald @Adam:
The Herald hardware prototypes are now undergoing full assembly! Half are Bluetooth DCT, accelerometer and light (RGB-IR) sensor main board only, half also have a daughter board for skin temperature, heart rate, and blood oxidation too. We’ll start testing the sensors (we may have assembled them wrong!) and then work on the full DCT wearable app in the next few weeks!
We will need donations in order to perform a full ‘production ready’ demo run when we have them all working. Please encourage anyone you know to donate funds to our project: https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/9e9b1ee2-23a8-44a5-83bc-e657fd4464ad

:rocket: The fourth update is from Covid Credentials Initiative @Lucy Yang (CCI):
On the Use Case Implementation Workstream call (recording here), @Lucy Yang (CCI) and @Savita Farooqui presented the GCCN User Flow V1 and identified potential areas of work and discussions that the CCI community could take on to contribute to the GCCN work and/or extend it to broader use cases. The attendees ask great questions and provided valuable insights from their own experience implementing COVID certificates.
The Vaccine Credentials US Subgroup had an open discussion about the US Federal agencies where the group could influence activities or look for funded opportunities, followed by a discussion of the GCCN User Flow V1 (recording here).

:globe_with_meridians: The fifth update is from Global COVID Certificate Network @Lucy Yang (CCI):
LFPH released the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN) User Flow V1 which focuses on demonstrating how GCCN will operationalize one of the core overarching recommendations of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint - the use of “a pass (that) encapsulates a business decision and only contains the data required to make that decision, filtering out all other unnecessary and sensitive personal health information.

:bulb: The sixth update is from Cardea @Trevor Butterworth:
This week, the Cardea working group discussed and agreed on vaccination exemptions for the Cardea schema (video of the meeting via Cardea.app soon). Next week we’ll tie up some loose threads and dive into discussion of how to handle the formats for machine readable governance rules. We’ve also just published an article on the importance of machine readable governance for overall governance, which includes reference to our experience implementing Cardea in Aruba: https://indicio.tech/blog/the-decentralized-identity-revolution-is-powered-by-machine-readable-governance/
