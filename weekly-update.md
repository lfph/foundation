## October 15, 2021

:cricket_bat_and_ball: For #cardea:

* Part one of our in-depth dive into machine-readable governance is now on YouTube—part two just took place and will be up soon! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdagONprW4E

:field_hockey_stick_and_ball: For #cci:

* CCI Steering Committee Member Election - Community Vote is still open. We have three great candidates @Chatchai @Trevor Butterworth @Ryan Barrett (NL) running for three seats. Vote for the one(s) you want to lead the community here.
* The newly-named Global Implementation Forum met on October 21 (recording here), where Rhonda Facile and Rebecca Kush from CDISC [Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium] presented their newly published Vaccine Administration V1.0, a mapping curation of minimum vaccination data elements and metadata and designed for travel use cases. The presentation led to a lively Q&A session where knowledgeable call participants provided feedback. For further updates on this CDISC initiative, don’t hesitate to contact @Lucy Yang (CCI) or @Paul Knowles.
* The APAC group #cci-apac-group will meet again on Oct 20 at 11 am HK / 8:30 am IST. We will have the team from DIVOC @Rajeesh Menon to provide the community an overview of their technology and existing implementations. 
* The Schema Task Force #cci-schema-tf met on October 11 (recording here). The group discussed the importance of data transformation objects and tools to enable attribute mapping and pipeline processing from Purpose-based Service Providers (PSP) to structured data capture forms, specifications, and standards defined by  Data Governance Authorities. This process directly contrasts the current situation where Insights-based Service Providers (ISP) dictate the data unification process, leading to the data’s original context often being lost, leading to contextual inaccuracies at the data aggregation stage. To be continued.

:ice_hockey_stick_and_puck: For #gccn:
* We had another GCCN Trust Registry Network Implementers’ meeting to provide the community an update on POC progress and share a drafted narrative to help governments understand the value of participating in the GCCN Trust Registry Network.

Keep an eye on the LFPH blog next week for more on the event—we’ll be discussing some of the technical aspects in detail in future Cardea meetings, but first—DemoDay on the 23rd will showcase Interop-athon participants interoperating!

:sewing_needle: For CCI,
* Application for our 2021 Steering Committee Members Election is open until 11:59 pm PT on September 15. We made it open this week the candidate marking sheet for applicants to refer to when preparing their CVs and Written/Video Pitches.

* The US Vaccine Credential Subgroup #cci-vaccinecredentialsfg-us met (recording here) to discuss what should the group focus on moving forward and how we can keep providing value. We had consensus from the group that we were going to expand the conversation to beyond vaccine credential and rename the group to become the North American Group. Similar to the APAC group, we will keep working with the community members to identify topics and have presentations and conversations relevant to the region.
* The Use Case Implementation Workstream’s next call on September 14 at 7 am PT / 2 pm UTC will have two professors from American University and University of Arkansas to share a “strawperson” (draft) list of 22 foundational requirements for Digital Health Passes, derived largely from the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.

We have finished the first round of streamlining of the new developer onboarding cookbook and are taking the first two new developers through it in the next 1-2 weeks.  We will publish the onboarding videos once we’ve finished successful developer onboarding with developer environment set up.  Our goal is new developers can have a full instance of MedCreds running in a developer environment in less than 3 hours.  We have also established the first running instance of “MedCreds inside” utilizing the open source code, a brand new instance from scratch at app.proofengage.io.  We’re still running it through testing and plan to open it up for anyone to establish their own “Engage, with MedCreds inside” wallet soon!

:herald: The third update is from Herald @Adam:
The Herald hardware prototypes are now undergoing full assembly! Half are Bluetooth DCT, accelerometer and light (RGB-IR) sensor main board only, half also have a daughter board for skin temperature, heart rate, and blood oxidation too. We’ll start testing the sensors (we may have assembled them wrong!) and then work on the full DCT wearable app in the next few weeks!
We will need donations in order to perform a full ‘production ready’ demo run when we have them all working. Please encourage anyone you know to donate funds to our project: https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/9e9b1ee2-23a8-44a5-83bc-e657fd4464ad

:bulb: The sixth update is from Cardea @Trevor Butterworth:
This week, the Cardea working group discussed and agreed on vaccination exemptions for the Cardea schema (video of the meeting via Cardea.app soon).
